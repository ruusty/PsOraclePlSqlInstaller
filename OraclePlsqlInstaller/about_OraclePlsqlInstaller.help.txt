Windows Credential Manager
    The Windows Credential Manager securely stores the Oracle Schema Passwords.

    The Powershell Module BetterCredentials  stores and retrieves the passwords.

    The Save-OracleCredentials, Remove-OracleCredential, Show-OracleCredentials
    cmdlets are used to manage the import of passwords from
    G:\MKT\DEPT\IT Spatial\OMS GIS\Support 'How To' Instruction\OMS-Oracle-Config\password-check\gis-oms-Oracle.xml
    to the Windows Credential Manager

    Save-OracleCredentials -sdlc dev -path "G:\MKT\DEPT\IT Spatial\OMS GIS\Support 'How To' Instruction\OMS-Oracle-Config\password-check\gis-oms-Oracle.xml"

    Get-SqlPlusCommands retrieves the passwords from the Windows Credential Manager
    and returns the SqlPlus.exe command line to run the pl/sql file including password.

    Launch the Credential Manager
    Win+R
    c:\windows\system32\control.exe /name Microsoft.CredentialManager
